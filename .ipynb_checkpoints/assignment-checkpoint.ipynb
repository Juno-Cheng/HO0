    "\n",
    "Notebooks such as this one have found widespread use for sharing code examples and instruction, especially in machine learning.\n",

    "### About Notebook for Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, notebooks are organized into \"cells\" that either contain HTML\n",
    "(usually rendered from [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) with optional [math](https://www.mathjax.org/#demo)),\n",
    "source code (e.g., Python snippets), or code outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "For hands-on assignments, you will be asked to complete \"Tasks\", denoted with an <span style=\"color: darkorange;\">orange star (★)</span>,\n",
    "usually involving the editing of Python source code cells, which can then be run interactively to generate output in the same notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to refer to [official resources](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) on [iPython notebooks](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/notebook.html)\n",
    "or the [Jupyter Lab interface](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html) for specific questions that you may have.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be some quirks and patterns that come with using notebooks for assignments that you will have to get used to.\n",
    "For example, all imports should always go in the first part of the first code cell in a notebook\n",
    "(as you can see in the next cell)."

    "### The Local Grader\n",

    "With each assignment, we will provide you with a script that we call the \"local grader\".\n",
    "The local grader will always be located in a file called `grade_local.py`,\n",
    "and it runs tests in the exact same way as the autograder\n",
    "(which assigns your actual grade for assignments and will be discussed in the next part of this assignment).\n",
    "The only difference is that the autograder is on a secure server and keeps its test cases secret.\n",
    "Therefore, running the local grader is a great way to get a feel for how the autograder behaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The infrastructure that the graders (both local and auto) use is publicly available in the [ucsc-cse40 package](https://github.com/ucsc-cse-40/ucsc-cse40).\n",
    "So if you are ever interested in how we are doing something, you can see for yourself.\n",
    "The local grader we provide you with only starts with **very** basic tests,\n",
    "but we encourage you to expand it with your own tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although designed for more robust testing,\n",
    "we can use the same tools that the local grader uses to test our simple `my_rounding_function()` function:"

    "## Part 3: The Autograder\n",
    "\n",
    "All your hands-on assignments will be graded by a system we call \"the autograder\".\n",
    "As mentioned in Part 2, the autograder uses the same testing infrastructure that the local grader uses.\n",
    "The only difference is that the autograder is run on a secure server (instead of your local machine)\n",
    "and the autograder has hidden tests that you cannot see (instead of just the tests located in `grade_local.py`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you submit an assignment to the autograder,\n",
    "it will test your code against secret test cases written by the TAs and assign your submission a score which it will send back to you.\n",
    "You can make as many attempts/submissions as you want.\n",
    "However, you should make sure to not abuse the autograder by using is as a complier or style checker.\n",
    "You should always run your local tests and the local grader before submitting to the autograder.\n",
    "When the autograder does not give you full credit for a task,\n",
    "try making a test case that is testing the same thing the autograder is and run your new test locally.\n",
    "Remember, the autograder is a shared resource for all students and you should be respectful by testing locally first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The score for your most recent submission is considered your current score on the assignment\n",
    "(ignoring late days and any manually graded components).\n",
    "Be careful when submitting past the assignment's deadline, because you will start using your late days.\n",
    "The current grade the autograder assigns you is considered official and will eventually be reflected on Canvas\n",
    "(which will be regularly updated with your most recent submission).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interacting with the Autograder\n",
    "\n",
    "All interaction with the autograder is done using the `cse40.autograder` tool included in the `ucsc-cse40` package.\n",
    "Once the `ucsc-cse40` package is installed on your machine, you can invoke the tool using `python3 -m`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can get a help prompt using:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -m cse40.autograder --help\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool has options to configure how it runs (as seen in the help prompt),\n",
    "but as long as you run the tool in your assignment directory (the one that this file lives in)\n",
    "then all the default options should work just fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submitting\n",
    "\n",
    "To submit your code, you can use the `submit` command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -m cse40.autograder submit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the grading was successful, then you will see output that is very similar to the local grader.\n",
    "For example, you may see output like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "The autograder successfully graded your assignment.\n",
    "Autograder transcript for project: Hands-On 0: Getting Started.\n",
    "Grading started at 2023-03-30 17:57 and ended at 2023-03-30 17:57.\n",
    "Q1: 0 / 100\n",
    "   NotImplemented returned.\n",
    "Style: 0 / 0\n",
    "   Style is clean!\n",
    "\n",
    "Total: 0 / 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your score on the assignment is determined by your most recent submission to the autograder.\n",
    "You can see the exact time the autograder accepted your submission by looking at the grading report it outputs.\n",
    "The time after \"Grading started at\" is your official submission time and will be used to compute any late days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this submission step is **required** for getting a grade for hands-on assignments.\n",
    "Just pushing your code in git (as some classes do) is not sufficient for receiving a grade.\n",
    "Since pushing code and getting graded are not linked in this class,\n",
    "we encourage you to commit and push your code in git often.\n",
    "\n",
    "For HO0, no points are awarded for having correct coding style,\n",
    "but that will change starting with HO1.\n",
    "You may have already noted that the local grader also runs style checks.\n",
    "You should make sure your style passes the local grader before submitting to the autograder\n",
    "(they check your code's style using the same infrastructure from the `ucsc-cse40` package).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checking Your Last Score\n",
    "\n",
    "You can ask the autograder to show you your last submission using the `repeat` command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -m cse40.autograder repeat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the lookup was successful, then you will see output that is very similar to when you submitted your code originally.\n",
    "For example, you may see output like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "The autograder successfully found your last attempt for this assignment.\n",
    "Autograder transcript for project: Hands-On 0: Getting Started.\n",
    "Grading started at 2023-03-30 17:57 and ended at 2023-03-30 17:57.\n",
    "Q1: 0 / 100\n",
    "   NotImplemented returned.\n",
    "Style: 0 / 0\n",
    "   Style is clean!\n",
    "\n",
    "Total: 0 / 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checking Your Score History\n",
    "\n",
    "To check all your previous scores for this assignment, you can use the `history` command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -m cse40.autograder history\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will return a summary of your past submissions, like:\n",
    "```\n",
